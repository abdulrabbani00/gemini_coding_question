# Running Code
This code utilized a docker container. The easiest way to run this code is to build this repository using devcontainer in vscode.

# Further Improvements

To further improve the code I would do the following.

1. Add the remaining checks.
2. Utilize a configuration file.
3. Add unit tests.

# Approach

To solve the problem I did the following:

1. Setup a logger function.
2. Query the API and find the necessary endpoints.
3. Create a function that evaluates the standard deviation.
4. Added the argparse. 
5. Tied everything in the main function.

## Time

This solution took me about 2 hours. Most of the time was taken up doing the following:
* Going through the API to find the right endpoint.
* Editing my logger.
* Organizing the code in a clear manner.
